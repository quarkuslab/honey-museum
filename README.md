# Setup Assets

This branch is dedicated to setting up and organizing all the assets required for the project. This includes images, fonts, icons, and other static resources.

## Purpose
The purpose of this branch is to ensure that all assets are properly structured and available for use across the project.

## Structure
- `/src/assets/images`: This directory will contain all images.
- `/src/assets/icons`: This directory will contain all icons.
- `/src/assets/fonts`: This directory will contain all font files.

## How to Use
1. Add all images, fonts, and other static files to their respective directories.
2. Ensure that the file names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention.
3. Update any relevant paths in the project codebase to reference these assets correctly.

## Next Steps
Once the assets are added and organized, create a pull request to merge this branch into `main`. Ensure that all assets are correctly referenced in the project before merging.
